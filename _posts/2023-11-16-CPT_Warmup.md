## What we are incorporating:

- Binary
- Logic Gates (NAND, AND, OR, NOT etc.)
- SASS Theme 
- Color Coding
- ASCII

### Binary:

- For the binary part we have incorporated a binary converter 
- The binary converter basically switches from hex to binary and the other way around
- We incorporated an input and it uses child classes and javascriptâ€™s built in binary code in order to help us with this part of the project
- We used SASS in order to change the team to make the UI look pleasing for the user and for us
	
### Logic Gates:
- For the logic gate part, we have incorporated an interactive truth table for all of the logic gates.
- Then we are planning to add a randomly generated quiz about logic gates which would randomly decide the inputs and outputs. Then the user would have to match it with the corresponding logic gate(s). Logic from the previous part (interactive truth table) will be used to check if the answer is correct.
- Then we would like to add an overall theme which would look good for the UI.
