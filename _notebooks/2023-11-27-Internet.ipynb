    "Every device connected to the internet is assigned a unique identifier called an IP address. This address helps in routing data to the correct destination.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is similar to how your home address is used to deliver mail to your house. IP addresses are typically represented in a 32-bit format, with each 8-bit segment separated by a period. However, with the growth of the internet, the number of available IP addresses is running out. To solve this problem, a new standard called IPv6 was introduced, which uses a 128-bit format."
